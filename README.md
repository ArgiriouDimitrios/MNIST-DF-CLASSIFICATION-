Project Overview

This project implements a multi‑class image classification pipeline for the MNIST‑like dataset using deep learning (TensorFlow / Keras).  
Each sample has shape **784 features** (flattened 28×28 images), and the task is to classify each image into one of 10 target classes.  
The repository contains all necessary code, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation logic.
